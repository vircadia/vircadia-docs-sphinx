* The ability for the Metaverse API (Grid Server) URL to be changed by script via settings has been added. No UI toggle has been added yet. (#33)

* Serverless JSON domains can now be loaded over HTTP. This means you can create a domain, export it to JSON, then upload it to a webserver to be visited in the Interface. (#160)

* Add a "More" app that lists and installs community-made scripts and apps directly from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vircadia/community-apps). (#187)
