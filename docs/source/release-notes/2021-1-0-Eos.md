### General

* UI/UX: The VR controls for regular and fullbody users has been overhauled. (#928)
    1. Fix being unable to sit in the real world in VR without the avatar and viewpoint being popped up to a standing position. With the new option "Allow my avatar to stand", we can choose to have the avatar stand only when the user is standing. The default behavior is the same as before (always allowed to stand; allowed to lean only when user is standing), except that now, when foot trackers are used, the avatar is never made to stand artificially.
    2. Fix very wrong walk/fly directions when using foot tracking or when using the mode that allows the avatar to sit when the user sits (previously "Avatar lean behavior: disabled").
    3. Fix VR walk speeds being too slow at small avatar scale and too fast at large avatar scale. The avatar scale was being factored-in twice in the velocity calculation.
    4. The "Avatar lean behavior" setting was unclear and had muddled logic. It's now split into two settings that work more usefully: "Allow my avatar to stand" and "Allow my avatar to lean".
    5. The previous experimental mode that allowed the avatar to sit on the floor ("Avatar leaning behavior: disabled") is improved by now having the avatar follow the user's orientation ("Allow my avatar to lean: Always, no recenter").
    6. Fix unreliable hand-relative walk/fly directions, due to avatar-frame vectors being wrongly transformed by the head rotation. UpdateMotors was transforming avatar-space directions by the head rotation (even if hand-relative walking was chosen). It could give the appearance of working, but only when the avatar rotation followed the head rotation.
    7. Fix for the recentering not behaving as requested by the user after getting up from click-to-sit (always popping up to standing position).
    8. Fix for incorrect vertical position of the avatar and viewpoint after changing recenter mode while not standing in the real world.
    9. The logic controlling the direction of `MyAvatar`'s action motor was hard to follow and maintain, as it was split between two functions. Now it's clearer and all done in `calculateScaledDirection`.
    10. Leaning and lean recentering now work as intended at any avatar scale.
* App: 'Create' app now has a "Rotate As The Next Clicked Surface" function for entities. (#932)
* API: Add `useOriginalPivot` property to model entities allowing entities to use their original pivot. (#951, #1029)
* Graphics: Improve rendering of transparent entities. (#953)
* API: Add `billboardMode` property for all entity types allowing entities to face the user as specified in the following modes: none, yaw, full. (#961, #1041)
* App: The 'Appreciate' app has been added as a default app to Interface. (#974)
* API: Add `userAgent` property to web entities allowing the web entity to use the specified user agent when browsing. (#998, #1017)
* App: Allow any user to teleport to any user within a domain using the 'People' app. (#991)
* API: Add `releaseName` property to the `About` API. (#996)
* API: Add `alignment` property to text entities allowing text to be aligned to 'left', 'center', and 'right'. (#1020)
* App: 'Create' app February 2021 improvements package. (#1030)
    * The Entity List menubar has been reorganized.
        - Introducing a new menu “Transform”. The menu items have been re-dispatched. CSS has been retouched to display clearly which menu is open.
    * New optional full path & file name URL column in the Entity List.
        - A new optional column “URL” has been added (hidden by default) to the Entity List. It displays the full URL including the path. The column is sortable. It is also searchable when visible.

### Miscellaneous

* Application: Add functionality to skip repeated log entries. (#937)
* Docs: List required dependency for Visual Studio on Windows builds. (#967)
* Application: Fix multiple crashes when using VR with a QML disabled build. (#971)
* Build: Vircadia now accepts the `RELEASE_NAME` env variable. (#975)
* Build: Updated Windows VCPKG to include an alternative JOM download URL instead of just Qt's. (#983)
* Build: Revise Windows build docs to improve formatting and list Node.JS as a dependency. (#987)
* Misc: 'Alpha' references have been removed for Interface indicating that Vircadia is now a full release. (#996)
* Misc: A reference to the former High Fidelity VR project has been added to the 'About' dialog alongside some formatting and build info updates. (#996)

## Domain Server

The numbers at the end of each item are the PR numbers in the Vircadia [repo](https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia).

### General

* Server/UI/UX: Wizard improvements. (#1009)
    * Add a list of acceptable characters to 'Create Domain ID' dialog.
    * The wizard now sets the server to use 'Full' automatic networking when connected to a metaverse.
    * If creating a domain ID, the wizard now has the server set its name to match the label used to create an ID.
