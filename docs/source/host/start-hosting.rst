We are thrilled you've decided to host a custom domain with us on the metaverse! We also understand that setting up a server, configuring it, and creating a domain takes some time and technical knowledge. Hopefully, this section will help you become familiar with the basics of hosting domains in Vircadia, so that you can create the space you want and be a part of building a bigger, more expansive metaverse. 

You can also follow the :doc:`quick start guide <quick-start>` to quickly boot up a domain to tinker with.

Overview of Hosting
----------------------------

Vircadia's hosting interface consists of the following components that work together to create an immersive VR experience for your visitors:

* The Vircadia *Sandbox* is a locally hosted environment on your computer that gives you a space to play around and build content in. You can register your Sandbox with the Metaverse to make it accessible from the outside world. The Sandbox is included with full Windows installers from the `Vircadia website <https://vircadia.com/download-vircadia/#windows>`_.
* A *domain* is a registered location in the metaverse. Each domain is assigned a unique ID to identify it. You can run a domain on a Windows or Linux machine.
* A *server* hosts a domain, and processes incoming network requests for the domain. The server for your domain is either a physical computer or a cloud-hosted server.
* A *droplet* or *cloud domain* is a cloud server hosted on DigitalOcean.
* A *content set* is the content that you've designed to make your domain unique and pretty.
