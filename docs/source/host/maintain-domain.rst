####################

Domain servers are generally managed and maintained by admins. As the domain owner, it is likely that you'll need to take some responsibility to keep your server running in good shape. Some of these tasks include creating backups, managing unruly visitors, updating software, and cleaning the domain of unnecessary entities and extraneous content.
