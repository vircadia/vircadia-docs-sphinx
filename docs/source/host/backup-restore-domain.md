## Backup Your Domain Content

You can use the [content archives](your-domain/configure-settings#content-archives) in your domain settings, to backup and restore your domain content. Content archives contain information about the 3D models, content settings, and assets in your Asset Server. 

By default, automatic content archives settings exist and create backups in intervals. You can access these archives or generate a new one to create a backup.

2. Go to 'Content' on the top menu bar and click 'Content Archives' from the drop-down menu. 
3. You can use one of the content archives or scroll down and generate a new one by clicking 'Generate New Archive'.
4. To download the backup folders, click the three dots under 'Actions' for the archive you chose. 
5. Click 'Download'. You will be prompted to save a folder with all content information on your computer.
