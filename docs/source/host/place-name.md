# Add a Place Name

All domains have a _place name_, which is an easy way for visitors to enter a domain. When you enter the place name into the [GoTo app](../explore/travel.html#goto-app), you will teleport to that domain. 

By default, every domain is assigned a random place name (such as "blue-bandwidth-86201"). While you are welcome to continue using this place name, purchasing a custom place name makes it easier for visitors to come to your virtual world. 

>>>>>To enter a domain, you must have the proper permissions. Simply knowing the place name is not sufficient to visit domains.

3. Type in your new Place Name. Place Names must be 4-64 characters in length. Letters, numbers and hyphens are allowed. You can use a Place Name that is currently not purchased. 
4. Click 'Checkout Now'.
5. Enter your credit card number, PayPal account information or a coupon code to complete the purchase.

## Add a Custom Place Name to Your Domain

After you purchase a Place Name, you need to connect it to your domain. If you do not already have a domain, make sure you [set one up](your-domain).

2. In the 'Metaverse/Networking' section, click 'Advanced Settings'. 
3. Copy the Domain ID. 
3. Go to [https://highfidelity.com/user/places](https://highfidelity.com/user/places) and edit the Place Name you purchased. 
4. Paste the domain ID you copied in the 'Points To' field. 
5. Enter a ['Path'](your-domain/configure-settings#set-an-entry-path-for-users), 'Description', and 'Preview Image' (optional).

7. Next, configure your domain server to use the domain of your choice (in case it already isn't configured). Right-click the High Fidelity icon on your system tray or top menu bar, and click 'Settings'.
8. In your domain server settings, under the 'Metaverse/Networking' section, click 'Advanced Settings'. 
9. Under 'Domain ID' click 'Choose from my domains' and select the domain of your choice.

## Connect New and Existing Place Names

1. Go to https://highfidelity.com/user/places. Edit the Place Name you purchased. 
2. Add the existing Place Name under the 'Points To' field. 
3. Enter a ['Path'](your-domain/configure-settings#set-an-entry-path-for-users), 'Description', and 'Preview Image' (optional).
