Create Tools
######################

To build and create things in Vircadia, you need to become familiar with the tools available to you. We've created our own custom tools (including the Create app). In addition, you can use many external tools to fine-tune your creations. These tools can help you create anything from a cool avatar or a baseball hat, to a magic themed domain.

---------------------
The Create App
---------------------

Use the **Create** app to create any :doc:`type of entity <entities/create-entities>`. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create** to get started. With the Create app, you can:

+ :doc:`Add any type of entity <entities/create-entities>` and import externally created :doc:`models <3d-models/import-model>` and :doc:`materials <entities/material-entity>`.
+ Edit entity properties, such as its :doc:`appearance <entities/entity-appearance>`, `position <entities/entity-appearance.html#move-an-entity>`_, and :doc:`behavior <entities/entity-behavior>`.
+ Expose a grid that assists you with the layout and placement of entities.
+ Display the `Entity List`_, which lists all the entities in the domain. When you're using an HMD, the entity list will be an additional tab in the Create app. In Desktop mode, the Entity List is its own window.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Entity List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Entity List shows you all entities in the local domain. You can filter by entity type and by distance from the current location.

At the top of the Entity List, you can switch between 'Local' and 'World' view. When set to 'Local', the position, size, and rotation settings for entities are set in reference to the parent entity. When set to 'World', these settings are set in reference to the world's default position.

When you select an entity in the Entity List, you can:

+ Find an entity: You can double-click an entity on the list to view it in your domain. You will see the entity with a bounding box and arrows around it.
+ Lock an entity: A locked entity cannot be edited. Select an entity and click the lock icon on the top of the window.
+ Change visibility: You can hide or make an entity visible. Select an entity and click the eye icon on the top of the window.
+ Name an entity: Name an entity when you select it on the list.
+ Delete an entity: Delete an entity by clicking on the red bin icon on the top-right corner of the window.
