Environments
####################

A High Fidelity domain can have an environment to express a theme. Environments include all the domain content, such as entities, skyboxes, assets, and more. You could have a domain with a deserted island environment or a cyberpunk apartment environment. 

Environments are available for :doc:`purchase on our Marketplace <../explore/shop>`. If you don't want to use any of the available environments, you can create your own.

Create an Environment

An environment consists different types of 3D models and a skybox following the theme of your choice. You can create an environment using:

+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method                 | Description                                                                                         |
+========================+=====================================================================================================+
| Marketplace Items      | You can :doc:`purchase various models <../explore/shop>` like buildings and skyboxes                |
|                        | from the Marketplace. For example, you can change the skybox in your domain by purchasing a         |
|                        | different one from the Marketplace.                                                                 |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3D Models Available    | You can purchase or :doc:`get 3D models <3d-models/get-model>` from online 3D content websites.     |
|                        | Then, you can `import these models using the Asset Server                                           |
|                        | <3d-models/import-model.html#import-3d-models-using-the-asset-server>`_.                            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Your 3D Models         | You can use 3D modeling software like Blender or Maya to create your own 3D models and              |
|                        | `import them into your High Fidelity domain                                                         |
|                        | <3d-models/import-model.html#import-3d-models-using-the-asset-server>`_.                            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A Content Archive File | High Fidelity domain settings have downloadable content archives. These archives are zip            |
|                        | files containing all domain content information. You can `use a backup file of your own or one      |
|                        | sent to you by a user <../host/backup-restore-domain.html#restore-your-domain>`_.                   |
