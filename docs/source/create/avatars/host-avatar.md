# Host Your Avatar

Before you can use a custom avatar, you must first host its FST and FBX files in a place that is publicly accessible to High Fidelity. You can use our servers or any cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, etc. 

If you have not yet done so, make sure that you have [packaged your model](create-avatars#package-your-avatar) prior to hosting it, so that it can be used in High Fidelity.
