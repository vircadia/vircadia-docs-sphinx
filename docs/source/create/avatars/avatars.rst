When you first use High Fidelity, you will be wearing the default avatar. Your avatar is a representation of you in the metaverse. You can make your time in High Fidelity unique by creating an avatar of your own. All custom avatars must be hosted somewhere in the cloud so that High Fidelity can access it.
