3D Models

3D models are :doc:`entities <entities>` that represent objects you'd like to see in-world such as a water fountain, a castle, or a coffee mug. You can get your 3D model by creating your own or sourcing it externally. We only support 3D models in the OBJ, FBX, and glTF formats.

The appearance of a 3D model is controlled by its materials. The materials supported in Vircadia are Physically-based Rendering (PBR) materials. This means that a 3D model's materials will reflect or absorb light as they would (approximately) in real life.
