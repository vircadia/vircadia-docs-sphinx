# Wearables

Wearables are objects that attach to your avatar. They can be hats, skirts, glasses, headphones and anything else that can accessorize your look in-world. You can express your individuality by creating wearables of your own and [putting them on](../../explore/personalize-experience/add-wearables). 

Before you can use a custom wearable, you must first host its FBX and JSON files in a place that is publicly accessible to High Fidelity.  You can use any cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, etc. You can also [upload your custom wearable to the Marketplace](../../sell/add-item) and sell it to others. 

## Build a Custom Wearable
Wearables are simply [3D models](../3d-models) that are customized to fit on your avatar. Therefore, the first step in creating your wearable is to build one or find an existing model that you want to use. 

There are a few different applications you can use to build and edit the 3D model for your wearable, including:
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org)
* [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview)
* [Google Blocks](https://vr.google.com/blocks)
* [Oculus Medium](https://www.oculus.com/medium)
* [Tiltbrush](https://www.tiltbrush.com)

When building your model, be sure to [follow these guidelines](../3d-models/get-model) to ensure that it is compatible with High Fidelity.  Once you're done editing your model, export the file as an FBX or OBJ file. You've now created your own custom model!

After hosting your wearable in the cloud or the Marketplace, [put it on](../../explore/personalize-experience/add-wearables) and adopt your new look.

>>>>>If you're creating a wearable to [add to the Marketplace](../../sell/add-item/upload-wearable), make sure it will fit the default wooden mannequin avatar (unless you are specifically making it to go with a very specific base avatar model). This will ensure that the wearable will work with most avatars in High Fidelity.
