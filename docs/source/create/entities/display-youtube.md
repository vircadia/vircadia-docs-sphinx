## Create a Web Entity

A web entity is a flat object on which you can view any website of your choosing. A web entity lets you access the internet from inside your domain. 

To create a web entity:

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**.
2. Click the 'Web' icon to create a web entity. By default, a web entity always displays High Fidelity's home page.

<div class="admonition note">
    <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
    <p>Currently, only 20 web entities can run at the same time in a domain to avoid performance issues. </p>
</div>

## Display High Fidelity's YouTube Channel

You can make the web entity display High Fidelity's YouTube channel.

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**. 
2. Select your web entity and go to the 'Properties' tab.
3. Scroll down until you see the 'Source URL' option. Enter the High Fidelity YouTube channel URL: https://www.youtube.com/user/HighFidelityio. You should see the new page as soon as you hit 'Enter'.
