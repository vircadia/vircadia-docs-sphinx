"Vircadia is an open-source project, so all of our code and documentation "
"is available for you to look at. You too can contribute to our endeavor "
"for the metaverse! Our main `git repository "
"<https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia>`_ contains the source to many of "
"the components of our software for creating virtual worlds. There are "
"plenty of ways you can contribute to the various parts that make up "

"As an international project, Vircadia relies on translators to be able to"
" reach users that do not speak English. Currently the only component that"
" has translation support is the documentation. You can help translating "
"using our online translation system `Weblate "
"<https://weblate.vircadia.dev>`_ by either submitting translations or "
"becoming a maintainer for your language and checking translations before "
"they make it into the documentation. More information on translating the "
"documentation can be found in its `README <https://github.com/vircadia"
"/vircadia-docs-sphinx/blob/master/README.md>`_."

"You can also put bounties on specific features you want to see "

"`issue tracker <https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia/issues>`_. Of "
"course, bounties are also an option for other parts of the project like "
"the documentation. Bounties are created and assigned based on trust, so "
"if you are unsure about something regarding one then speak to a core "
"developer or bring it up at a community or developer meeting. Most of the"
" developers are highly trained and experienced, normally earning upwards "
"of US$40 an hour in the free market. Keep that in mind if you want to see"
" something accomplished that no one else is personally interested in."
